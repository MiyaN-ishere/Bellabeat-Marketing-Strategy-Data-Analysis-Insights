## Key Findings & Business Impact  

- The daily engagement rate was low (~5.71%) from March 12 to March 24, indicating limited user activity.
- Engagement gradually increased from March 25, reaching 31.43% by March 31 and peaking at 100% from April 2 to April 5.
- Post-April 5, engagement declined to 68.57% by April 12, highlighting potential retention challenges.
- The early April engagement surge suggests a successful campaign or feature launch, which should be analyzed and replicated.
- The decline in engagement indicates a need for retention strategies, such as push notifications, loyalty programs, and personalized marketing.

## Recommendations
- Implement a loyalty program to sustain engagement.
- Use push notifications & in-app challenges to encourage daily activity.
- Analyze user behavior around April 1-5 to identify key engagement drivers.
- Personalize marketing efforts to improve user retention.
